    "description": "<p>The Federal Reserve delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut on October 29, bringing the target range down to 3.75%–4.00% — the first easing move in months. However, what truly unsettled the markets was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s statement that a further cut in December is “not a foregone conclusion.”</p><p></p><p>Powell’s remarks signaled a deep divide within the FOMC over the pace of monetary easing, leaving traders uncertain about policy direction heading into year-end. The reaction was swift — Bitcoin slid roughly 3%, while Ethereum, XRP, and other altcoins lost between 2% and 5%, as risk sentiment soured across digital assets.</p><p></p><p>Analysts say the crypto market could face heightened volatility in November, with macro signals now taking the driver’s seat for Bitcoin’s next major move.</p>",
